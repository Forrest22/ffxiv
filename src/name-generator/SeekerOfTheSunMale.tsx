            Most males have simple names. The extra “h”s (e.g. “B<b>h</b>ee”, “Kuz<b>h</b>”, and “Pa<b>h</b>sh”) represent a slight hissing/spitting sound that are pronounced by the Miqo’te and ignored by the other races.

            The forename is always preceeded by a letter representing their tribe. Tribe names are based on traditional beastkin, scalekin, or cloudkin totems said to protect the tribe.

            Males do not have surnames, as they are considered origins of new families, and will instead take on “Tia” or “Nunh” denoting their position within the tribe. All are born as tia and may challenge a tribe nunh to battle. If the tia is victorious, he takes the nunh’s title and position as tribe breeding male. A ratio of one nunh per fifty females is average. A tia may also become a nunh by leaving to start his own tribe.
